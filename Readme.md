# Learn Generative AI with PyTorch

Welcome to the **Learn Generative AI with PyTorch** repository, organized by **GloVersity (GloProg)**. This repository contains all the work, assignments, and code examples discussed during the **Online Sessions** aimed at helping students master generative AI using the PyTorch framework.

This repository is part of **Quarter 4** of the **Certified Cloud Native Applied Generative AI Engineer** program.

## Overview

The **Learn Generative AI with PyTorch** sessions focus on the hands-on process of building and training AI models using **Python** and the versatile, open-source **PyTorch** framework. Throughout this course, you will delve into the core concepts of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, **Transformers**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Variational Autoencoders**, **Diffusion Models**, and **LangChain**.

By the end of this quarter, you will gain practical experience and a deep understanding of these cutting-edge technologies, empowering you to create and deploy sophisticated generative AI applications.

### Instructors:
- **Abdul Qadir Imran** - Lead Instructor, DevOps Engineer (DOE)
- **Abdullah Iqbal** - Co-Instructor, Full Stack Developer (FSD)

### Learning Goals:
- Build and train AI models using **PyTorch**
